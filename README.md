NumPy and Matplotlib libraries
Implement Root Finding methods, particularly, Bisection and Newton-
Raphson methods, to find all the possible roots of a given function and verify it with built-in functions
scipy.optimize.root() in the SciPy library. Algorithm/Pseudocode for the two methods 

1. 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥2 ― 𝑥 ― 1
2. 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥3 ― 𝑥2 ― 2𝑥 + 1

Implement Midpoint Approximation and Trapezium Rule to
perform numerical integration of a given function and limit, and compare the result with the
Analytical result.

1. 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥
𝑥2+1 and Limits [0, 5]
2. 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑒𝑥 and Limits [0, 5]

Use implemented functions to evaluate the definite integrals of the above functions over their
corresponding limits. Verify answers with the Analytical (true value obtained by definite
integrals) results. 

1. 𝑥
𝑥2 + 1 𝑑𝑥 = 1
2 log |1 + 𝑥2| + 𝐶
2. ∫ 𝑒𝑥 𝑑𝑥 = 𝑒𝑥 + 𝐶
